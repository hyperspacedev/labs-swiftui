/**
The different ways you can display an status with ``StatusView``.
As of Starlight v1.0, there are two ways to display mastodon statuses:
    
- Compact: The status is being displayed from the a list, usually an instance of ``StatusList``,
    so the status should be smaller and more compact, efficiently using space to provide as many
    information we can.
 
 <br>

- Presented: The status is the main post in a thread, so we can make it bigger, and display more information,
    such as the full date the status was posted, the author's full display name and username, etc.
    Presented statuses are generally bigger because they are the main post, so we need to make it easier to distinguish
    from the other statuses in the thread.
